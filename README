General concepts:

- 'master'
A yorick process responsible to create shared memory segment.

- 'slave(s)'
A yorick process(es) accessing the shared memory segment.

Both master and slaves have r/w to shared mem.
A yorick process may be both a master and a client.

Master and clients need to agree on an initial 'key' by which they'll be
able to 

- add quit hook so 'masters' (the yorick that create the shm)

//---------------------------------------------------------------

Flexibility can be overwhelming, you may find some benefits
simplifying how you use the API.
We could make some wrappers helping this too.

- master / slave(s)
